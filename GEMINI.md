# GEMINI.md - Instructional Context

## Project Overview
This project, titled **"Giga Chad's Bare Worktree Guide,"** is an educational resource and interactive guide for implementing the "Bare Hub Architecture" in Git. It focuses on using Git worktrees to decouple the Git engine from the working directory, allowing for high-performance, parallel development workflows.

### Main Technologies
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Core structure and custom "Industrial Brutalist" styling.
- **Vanilla CSS**: Used for bespoke, high-performance UI without the "AI slop" look of default frameworks.
- **Git**: The central subject of the guide.

### Architecture
The project itself is a single-page static site (`index.html`) that serves as both a demonstration and a manual. It employs an "Industrial Brutalist" aesthetic—focusing on raw typography, matte blacks, and metallic gold accents—to provide a professional, high-performance atmosphere.

## Building and Running
Since this is a static HTML project, there are no complex build steps.

- **To View the Guide**: Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
- **Development**: Edits to `index.html` will be reflected immediately upon browser refresh.

## Development Conventions
- **Thematic Consistency**: All documentation and UI elements should adhere to the "Industrial Brutalist" persona and palette (#111111 Matte Black, #D4AF37 Metallic Gold, #F2F2F2 Concrete White).
- **Visualization**: Use raw CSS grids and high-impact typography for visualizations. Avoid overused neon gradients and glassmorphism.
- **No Heavy Dependencies**: Keep the project lightweight and dependency-free to maintain a fast-loading, professional footprint.
