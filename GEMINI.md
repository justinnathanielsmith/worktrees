# GEMINI.md - Instructional Context

## Project Overview
This project, titled **"Giga Chad's Bare Worktree Guide,"** is an educational resource and interactive guide for implementing the "Bare Hub Architecture" in Git. It focuses on using Git worktrees to decouple the Git engine from the working directory, allowing for high-performance, parallel development workflows.

### Main Technologies
- **Astro 4.x+**: Modern static site generator for superior performance and componentization.
- **Vanilla CSS**: Used for bespoke, high-performance UI without the "AI slop" look of default frameworks.
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring type safety across components.
- **Git**: The central subject of the guide.

### Architecture
The project is built with Astro, employing a component-based architecture to manage its "High-Performance Cyber" aesthetic. It decouples UI logic into reusable components (`Hero`, `Protocol`, `CodeBlock`, etc.) while maintaining a zero-JS footprint by default.

## Building and Running
- **Development**: `npm run dev` to start the Astro dev server.
- **Build**: `npm run build` to generate the static site in the `dist/` directory.
- **Deployment**: Automated via GitHub Actions using the 2026 best practices (parallel builds, environment protection).

## Development Conventions
- **Thematic Consistency**: All documentation and UI elements should adhere to the "High-Performance Cyber" persona and palette (Neon Cyan, Pink, Green, and Deep Slate).
- **Visualization**: Use neon gradients, glassmorphism, and interactive feedback to visualize complex Git flows.
- **No Heavy Dependencies**: Keep the project lightweight and dependency-free to maintain a fast-loading, professional footprint.
