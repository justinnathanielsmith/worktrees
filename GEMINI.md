# GEMINI.md - Instructional Context

## Project Overview
This project, titled **"Giga Chad's Bare Worktree Guide,"** is an educational resource and interactive guide for implementing the "Bare Hub Architecture" in Git. It focuses on using Git worktrees to decouple the Git engine from the working directory, allowing for high-performance, parallel development workflows.

### Main Technologies
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Core structure and styling.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used via CDN for rapid, modern UI components.
- **Chart.js**: Used via CDN to visualize performance metrics and workflow comparisons.
- **Git**: The central subject of the guide.

### Architecture
The project itself is a single-page static site (`index.html`) that serves as both a demonstration and a manual. It employs a "Neon Cyber-Future" aesthetic to engage users.

## Building and Running
Since this is a static HTML project, there are no complex build steps.

- **To View the Guide**: Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
- **Development**: Edits to `index.html` will be reflected immediately upon browser refresh.
- **TODO**: If this project expands, consider adding a local development server (e.g., `browser-sync` or `live-server`).

## Development Conventions
- **Thematic Consistency**: All documentation and UI elements should adhere to the "Giga Chad / High-Performance" persona and "Neon Cyber-Future" color palette (#0f172a, #1e293b, #06b6d4, #ec4899, #10b981).
- **Visualization**: Use Chart.js for any data or workflow comparisons.
- **No Heavy Dependencies**: Prefer CDNs for libraries like Tailwind and Chart.js to keep the repository lightweight and focused on content.
- **Worktree Hygiene**: Follow the "Execution Protocol" defined in the README when demonstrating or testing Git commands.
