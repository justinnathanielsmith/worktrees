# Contributing to Bare Hub

Thank you for your interest in improving the Bare Hub architecture. We follow a strict High-Performance Cyber philosophy: visual impact, neon precision, and no-nonsense documentation.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Clone it using the Bare Worktree workflow.
2.  **Create a Worktree**: `git worktree add -b feature/your-feature dev`
3.  **Implement Changes**: Ensure your styles follow the High-Performance Cyber aesthetic (neon gradients, glassmorphism, glowing accents).
4.  **Submit a Pull Request**: Describe the performance impact or architectural benefit of your change.

## Style Guidelines

- **Typography**: Use 'Bebas Neue' for impact and 'Inter' for clarity.
- **Colors**: Stick to the Neon Cyan, Pink, and Deep Slate palette.
- **Git**: Never commit build artifacts. Keep the engine clean.

Stay Optimized. Stay Neon.
