# 🔱 Giga Chad Bare Worktree Guide

> **Live Demo:** [https://justinnathanielsmith.github.io/worktrees/](https://justinnathanielsmith.github.io/worktrees/)

Standard Git setups are high-latency and low-aesthetic. This repository contains the source for the **Bare Hub Architecture Guide**—an elite interactive experience for devs who want to decouple their Git engine from their muscle.

## 🧠 The Philosophy

We don't "checkout" branches. We spawn them.
We don't "wait" for tests. We run them in parallel.
We don't "clutter" our root. We hide the engine in `.bare`.

## 🛠 The Architecture

The interactive guide covers the core pillars of the Bare Hub setup:

1.  **The Engine**: Initializing the repository as a bare repo in `.bare`.
2.  **The Brain**: Connecting the root directory to the engine via a `.git` pointer file.
3.  **The Muscle**: Spawning dedicated worktrees for every branch.
4.  **The Gains**: Parallel builds, instant branch switching, and AI-sandboxing.

## 🚀 Interactive Guide Source

This site is built with **Astro 4.x+** and **Tailwind CSS**, featuring a **High-Performance Cyber** aesthetic.

### Local Development

Get the engine running locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/justinnathanielsmith/worktrees.git
cd worktrees

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

### Production Build

Generate the optimized static muscle:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for zero-latency deployment.

## 🔱 Join the Elite

Standard Git is for the weak. Bare Hub is for the Giga Chads.
